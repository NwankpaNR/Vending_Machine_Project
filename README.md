# Python Vending_Machine

In this beginner project, I aimed to design a vending machine using python
There are four modules namely:
    prompt.py: Run prompt to start machine and choose the option you want
    add.py: this module is where an administrator is able to add products to the machine (needs improvement)
    buy.py: this is the module where customer is able to make a purchase.
    variable.py: This module contains variables that are used in other modules.

Admin password for adding product is  "12345"
